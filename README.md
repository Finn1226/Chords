# Welcome to ChordFanta

My name is Yifei Li and I created this app for guitar players who are learning how to play chords.

## How do I use it?

1. Input Chord names to the search bar

   For example: C, Cmaj, Cm

2. The app will show you a list of chords you might be looking for

   For example: if you inputted Cmaj, it will show you: Cmaj, Cmaj7, Cmaj9, etc.

3. Select the chord you want to learn, and the app will show you where to place your fingers on the frets.

## Have fun!
